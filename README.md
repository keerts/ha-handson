## Excercises

### Make Alexa and Google Home talk to each other

### Check out the CEC module with Home Assistant

### KNX

There is only one spot for this excercise and you are going to need GJ's computer with the physical KNX key installed.

The Mac address of the KNX IP module is 80:2a:a8:99:86:7e, but what you really need is the *ip address*, which is *...*

The installed modules are:
 
TXA 111 (just the power supply)
TXA 610D: This is a 10-fold switch actuator. It has 4 outlets wired to it and 4 additional indicator lights.
